PRO Version Features
===================================

**Shadow Robot**'s premium features
----------------------

- Items command
  
.. code-block:: console

   print the current stored items of a category
   
- Database Limit Increased

.. code-block:: console

   increases the database limit to 5 while the standard version's limit is 2
   
- Advertising

pro version's clients have the ability to enroll to advertising

How this works ?
.. code-block:: console

   when users receive the items they will get an advertisement along with the item
   the advertisement is random and the chance is equal to all the pro version clients




.. note::

   This project is still in beta.
